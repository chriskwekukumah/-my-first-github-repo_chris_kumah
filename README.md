## Why I built this
I wanted to explore how R handles data-driven arithmetic. 
Instead of just doing calculations, I built functions that:
- **Validate Input:** My `convert_temperature` function stops if you give it bad data.
- **Scale:** My `flexible_plot` allows the user to perform arithmetic on coordinates and then style the graph however they want.
